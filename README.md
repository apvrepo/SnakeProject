# Snake Project: 

This project is a customized adaptation of the classic mobile game Snake 2, which was originally pre-installed on Nokia 1100 cell phones. The game has been reimagined as a custom Salesforce application while preserving its core mechanics.

In this version, the game seamlessly integrates with Salesforce, allowing instance users to play while tracking their scores and rankings within the platform. This integration enables real-time leaderboards, fostering engagement and competition among users.
